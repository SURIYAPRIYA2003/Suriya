# This problem was asked by Twitter.

# Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string [s] and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have s as a prefix.
# For example, given the query string [de] and the set of strings [[dog], [deer], [deal]], return [[ deer deal]].

array = list(input().split(' '))
input = input()
new_array = []

for i in array:
    if input in i:
        new_array.append(i)

print(new_array)
