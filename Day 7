Given a list of integers,write a function that returns
the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers.
Numbers can be 0 or negative.
For example,[2,4,6,2,5] should return
13,since we pick 2,6 and 5.
[5,1,1,5] should return 10,since we pick 5 and 5.*

def maxSum(arr,i):
    if(i==0):
        return arr[i]
    if(i==1):
        return max(arr[i-1], arr[i])
    else:
        return max(maxSum (arr,i-1), arr[i]+maxSum (arr,i-2))
